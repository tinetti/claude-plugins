# UI Prototype

Generate **several radically different UI variations** on a single route, switchable from a floating bottom bar. The user flips between variants in the browser, picks one (or steals bits from each), then throws the rest away.

If the question is about logic/state rather than what something looks like — wrong branch. Use [LOGIC.md](LOGIC.md).

## When this is the right shape

- "What should this page look like?"
- "I want to see a few options for this dashboard before committing."
- "Try a different layout for the settings screen."
- Any time the user would otherwise spend a day picking between three vague mockups in their head.

## Two sub-shapes — strongly prefer sub-shape A

A UI prototype is much easier to judge when it's **butting up against the rest of the app** — real header, real sidebar, real data, real density. A throwaway route on its own is a vacuum: every variant looks fine in isolation. Default to sub-shape A whenever there's a plausible existing page to host the variants. Only reach for sub-shape B if the prototype genuinely has no nearby home.

### Sub-shape A — adjustment to an existing page (preferred)

The route already exists. Variants are rendered **on the same route**, gated by a `?variant=` URL search param. The existing data fetching, params, and auth all stay — only the rendering swaps. This is the default; pick it unless there's a specific reason not to.

If the prototype is for something that doesn't yet have a page but _would naturally live inside one_ (a new section of the dashboard, a new card on the settings screen, a new step in an existing flow) — that's still sub-shape A. Mount the variants inside the host page.

### Sub-shape B — a new page (last resort)

Only use this when the thing being prototyped genuinely has no existing page to live inside — e.g. an entirely new top-level surface, or a flow that can't be embedded anywhere sensible.

Create a **throwaway route** following whatever routing convention the project already uses — don't invent a new top-level structure. Name it so it's obviously a prototype (e.g. include the word `prototype` in the path or filename). Same `?variant=` pattern.

Before committing to sub-shape B, sanity-check: is there really no existing page this could be embedded in? An empty route hides design problems that a populated one would expose.

In both sub-shapes the floating bottom bar is identical.

## Process

### 1. State the question and pick N

Default to **3 variants**. If the question is genuinely binary ("tabs or sidebar?"), 2 is fine — don't manufacture a third. More than 5 stops being radically different and starts being noise — cap there.

Write down the plan in one line, in the prototype's location or a top-of-file comment:

> "Three variants of the settings page, switchable via `?variant=`, on the existing `/settings` route."

This works whether the user is here to push back or not.

### 2. Generate radically different variants

Draft each variant. Hold each one to:

- The page's purpose and the data it has access to.
- The project's component library / styling system (Tailwind, shadcn, MUI, plain CSS, whatever — adapt to the project's framework).
- A clear exported component name, e.g. `VariantA`, `VariantB`, `VariantC`.

Variants must be **structurally different** — different layout, different information hierarchy, different primary affordance, not just different colours. Three slightly-tweaked card grids isn't a UI prototype, it's wallpaper. If two drafts come out too similar, redo one with explicit "do not use a card grid" guidance.

**Use realistic data** — real string lengths, real item counts, real edge cases like long names or empty states. Lorem ipsum and 3-item placeholder lists hide the UX problems the prototype is supposed to find. If the page fetches real data, use it. If not, write fixtures that match production shapes and volumes.

### 3. Scaffold, then wire together

Run the scaffolder to generate the `PrototypeSwitcher` component, variant shell files, and wiring example:

```bash
npx tsx ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/prototype/scripts/scaffold.ts ui \
  --variants 3 --framework next --outdir <target-dir>
```

This creates an `__prototype/` directory with:
- `PrototypeSwitcher.tsx` — the floating bottom bar (keyboard nav, URL param sync, production guard)
- `VariantA.tsx`, `VariantB.tsx`, `VariantC.tsx` — shell files to fill in
- `wiring-example.tsx` — copy-paste snippet showing how to mount in the route

For non-React frameworks (Vue, Svelte), the scaffolder creates the directory structure — adapt the components to your framework's conventions. The pattern is identical: variants as components, switcher reads a URL search param.

Wire the switcher into the route:

```tsx
const variant = searchParams.get('variant') ?? 'A';
return (
  <>
    {variant === 'A' && <VariantA {...data} />}
    {variant === 'B' && <VariantB {...data} />}
    {variant === 'C' && <VariantC {...data} />}
    <PrototypeSwitcher variants={['A', 'B', 'C']} current={variant}
      onChange={(v) => router.replace(`?variant=${v}`)} />
  </>
);
```

For sub-shape A (existing page): keep all the existing data fetching above the switcher; only the rendered subtree changes per variant.

For sub-shape B (new page): the throwaway route under `/prototype/<name>` mounts the same switcher.

Now fill in each variant file with a **structurally different** layout — the scaffolder only gives you the shell.

### 5. Hand it over

Surface the URL (and the `?variant=` keys). The user will flip through whenever they get to it. The interesting feedback is usually **"I want the header from B with the sidebar from C"** — that's the actual design they want.

### 6. Capture the answer and clean up

Once a variant has won, write down which one and why (commit message, ADR, issue, or a `NOTES.md` next to the prototype if running AFK and the user hasn't responded yet). Then:

- **Sub-shape A** — delete the losing variants and the switcher; fold the winner into the existing page.
- **Sub-shape B** — promote the winning variant to a real route, delete the throwaway route and the switcher.

Don't leave variant components or the switcher lying around. They rot fast and confuse the next reader.

## Anti-patterns

- **Variants that differ only in colour or copy.** That's a tweak, not a prototype. Real variants disagree about structure.
- **Sharing too much code between variants.** A shared `<Header>` is fine; a shared `<Layout>` defeats the point. Each variant should be free to throw out the layout.
- **Wiring variants to real mutations.** Read-only prototypes are fine. If a variant needs to mutate, point it at a stub — the question is "what should this look like", not "does the backend work".
- **Placeholder data that hides UX problems.** Three items looks fine; fifty with long titles breaks. Use realistic volumes and edge cases.
- **Promoting the prototype directly to production.** The variant code was written under prototype constraints (no tests, minimal error handling). Rewrite it properly when you fold it in.
