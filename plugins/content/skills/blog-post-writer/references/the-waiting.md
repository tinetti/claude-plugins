# The Waiting Framework

Adapted from Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot." Structure a post around something that was promised, anticipated, or expected — but never arrived, or arrived so transformed that it barely resembled the original promise. Meaning emerges from the anticipation itself, not the resolution. The waiting changes the waiters more than the arrival ever could.

## Best For

- Long-running migration stories
- Vaporware and delayed feature narratives
- Technical debt posts where "we'll fix it later" became permanent
- "The rewrite that never happened" posts
- Posts about promised tools, frameworks, or paradigm shifts that stalled
- Waiting for organizational change that never comes

## The Steps

### 1. The Promise (What Everyone Believed Was Coming)

Establish what was expected. Be specific about the promise — who made it, when, what it was supposed to look like. The promise needs to feel reasonable and exciting. The audience should think "yeah, I'd wait for that too."

**Example:** "In 2022, our tech lead presented the plan: we'd migrate from our hand-rolled state management to a proper solution. Six weeks, maybe eight. The legacy store was a 3,000-line file that everyone touched and nobody owned. The migration would give us type safety, dev tools, and an end to the merge conflicts that had become a team ritual. Everyone nodded. Everyone believed. I put 'State Migration Complete' on the Q3 roadmap."

### 2. The Absence (It Doesn't Arrive)

The deadline passes without drama. Not with a bang — with silence. Show how the non-arrival is gradual and quiet. Nobody announces the delay. The date just... passes. Then another date passes. The absence should feel familiar to anyone who's worked in software.

**Example:** "Q3 came and went. The migration ticket moved from 'In Progress' to 'Blocked' — something about the API layer needing to change first. Q4: the ticket was still there, now labeled 'Next Quarter.' The tech lead who proposed it had moved to another team. The new tech lead inherited the ticket and the optimism. 'We'll knock this out in January,' she said. January came. The ticket didn't move. Nobody mentioned it. It just sat in the backlog like furniture you've stopped seeing."

### 3. The Coping (Workarounds That Become Load-Bearing)

Show what fills the absence. When the real solution doesn't arrive, temporary fixes become permanent infrastructure. Document the workarounds with the same precision you'd document a real architecture — because they ARE the real architecture now.

**Example:** "We wrote a wrapper around the legacy store. Then a wrapper around the wrapper, because the first wrapper's API wasn't quite right. Someone built a custom hook called `useStore` that did an unholy transformation between the old shape and what components actually needed. We added a linting rule to prevent direct store access, then added seventeen `eslint-disable` comments when the rule broke the build. Each workaround was a small, reasonable decision. Together, they formed a shadow architecture that nobody had designed and everybody depended on."

### 4. The Turn (Recognition That the Waiting Itself Changed the Outcome)

The key insight: the thing you were waiting for is no longer the thing you need. The codebase changed while you waited. The team changed. The requirements changed. The promise aged out. Show the moment this becomes clear.

**Example:** "Two years in, a new developer asked why we weren't using the state library that was in the Q3 2022 roadmap. I started to explain the blocking issues and realized, halfway through, that most of them didn't exist anymore. The API layer had been rewritten for unrelated reasons. The type system had evolved. But the migration plan was built for a codebase that no longer existed. We weren't waiting for the solution anymore. We were waiting for a solution to a problem we'd already worked around. The waiting had made the promise obsolete."

### 5. Still Waiting (Return to Opening State, But Transformed)

End where you began — but different. The promise might still be on a roadmap somewhere. The ticket might still exist. But you and the codebase have been changed by the waiting. The circular structure isn't defeat; it's recognition. Some things in software are permanent states, not temporary ones.

**Example:** "The migration ticket is still in our backlog. It's been re-estimated twice, rescoped three times, and assigned to four different developers. The current assignee is on parental leave. I don't think we'll ever do it — not because it's impossible, but because we've been waiting so long that the workarounds *are* the system now. And that's okay. The 3,000-line legacy store is now 4,200 lines, but it works. The shadow architecture holds. Some things you wait for arrive. Some things you wait for teach you to stop waiting. I put 'Evaluate state management approach' on next quarter's roadmap. Force of habit."

## Structure Notes

**Principles:**
- **Repetition with variation.** Return to the same details — the ticket, the roadmap, the line count — but each time they've changed slightly. This creates the rhythm of waiting.
- **Dignity in persistence.** The people waiting aren't fools. They're making rational decisions in the face of uncertainty. Honor that.
- **Comedy as survival mechanism.** The humor should feel like coping, not commentary. Dry observations about the absurdity of the situation, not jokes at anyone's expense.

**Pacing:** The Promise is ~15%. The Absence is ~20%. The Coping is the richest section, ~30% — the workarounds are the real story. The Turn is ~20%. Still Waiting is ~15%.

**The circular structure is the message.** Starting and ending in a similar place isn't a failure of storytelling — it's the point. The reader should feel the weight of the loop closing.

## Combination Notes

- **Sisyphean Arc:** Both deal with endurance without resolution. The Sisyphean arc is active (the work continues); The Waiting is passive (the resolution doesn't arrive). They merge when you're doing the repetitive work *while* waiting for the thing that would make it unnecessary.
- **Existential Awakening:** The awakening is realizing the waiting has changed you more than the arrival would have. The turn in step 4 IS an existential awakening.
- **Catch-22:** You're trapped by the wait: you can't start the migration because of blockers, and you can't remove the blockers without the migration. The Catch-22 lives inside The Waiting.
- **Kafkaesque Labyrinth:** The system that promises but doesn't deliver. The labyrinth's bureaucracy is why the promise keeps slipping.

## When NOT to Use This

If the thing actually arrived and worked, this is the wrong framework. Use Story Circle (the journey to getting it) or PAS (the problem the arrival solved).

If the waiting period was brief and the resolution satisfying, don't stretch it into a Beckett play. Quick waits with good outcomes are PAS or SCQA posts.

Avoid if you're genuinely angry about the delay. The Waiting framework requires a philosophical tone — bemused acceptance, not frustration. If you're still frustrated, the post will read as a passive-aggressive status update. Wait until you've processed the emotion, or use Kafkaesque Labyrinth to channel the frustration at the system instead.
