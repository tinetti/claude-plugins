# {Project Name} Contract

**Created**: {date}
**Confidence Score**: {score}/100
**Status**: Draft | Approved

## Problem Statement

{1-3 paragraphs describing:

- What pain point exists
- Who experiences it
- Why it matters
- What happens if not solved}

## Goals

{Numbered list of 3-5 specific, measurable goals. Each goal should answer "what does success look like?"}

1. {Goal 1 with measurable outcome}
2. {Goal 2 with measurable outcome}
3. {Goal 3 with measurable outcome}

## Success Criteria

{Bulleted checklist of testable acceptance criteria. These should be verifiable.}

- [ ] {Criterion 1 - specific and testable}
- [ ] {Criterion 2 - specific and testable}
- [ ] {Criterion 3 - specific and testable}
- [ ] {Criterion 4 - specific and testable}

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

{Explicit list of what IS included in this project}

- {Feature/capability 1}
- {Feature/capability 2}
- {Feature/capability 3}

### Out of Scope

{Explicit list of what is NOT included, with brief rationale}

- {Excluded item 1} - {why excluded}
- {Excluded item 2} - {why excluded}

### Future Considerations

{Items explicitly deferred to later phases or projects}

- {Deferred item 1}
- {Deferred item 2}

## Execution Plan

_Added during Phase 5 handoff. Pick up this contract cold and know exactly how to execute._

### Dependency Graph

{ASCII diagram showing phase dependencies. Use arrows for blocking relationships.}

```
Phase 1: {title}
  ├── Phase 2: {title}  (blocked by Phase 1)
  └── Phase 3: {title}  (blocked by Phase 1)
        └── Phase 4: {title}  (blocked by Phase 3)
```

### Execution Steps

{Ordered list of commands. Mark sequential vs parallel.}

**Strategy**: {Sequential | Agent Team | Hybrid}

1. **Phase 1** — {title} _(blocking)_
   ```bash
   /execute-spec docs/ideation/{project-name}/spec-phase-1.md
   ```

2. **Phases 2 & 3** — parallel after Phase 1
   {See agent team prompt below, or run sequentially:}
   ```bash
   /execute-spec docs/ideation/{project-name}/spec-phase-2.md
   /execute-spec docs/ideation/{project-name}/spec-phase-3.md
   ```

3. **Phase 4** — {title} _(blocked by Phase 3)_
   ```bash
   /execute-spec docs/ideation/{project-name}/spec-phase-4.md
   ```

### Agent Team Prompt

{Only if 2+ phases are parallelizable. Ready-to-paste prompt for delegate mode (Shift+Tab). Omit this section entirely for fully sequential projects.}

```
{Paste-ready agent team prompt with teammate assignments, spec paths, and coordination notes}
```

## Template Usage Notes

When filling this template:

1. **Problem Statement**: Be specific about WHO has the problem and WHAT the impact is. Avoid vague statements like "things are slow" - instead say "API response times exceed 2s for 40% of users, causing 15% cart abandonment."

2. **Goals**: Use measurable language. Instead of "improve performance," say "reduce p95 latency from 2s to 500ms."

3. **Success Criteria**: Write as if you're writing test cases. Each criterion should be pass/fail verifiable.

4. **Scope Boundaries**: When in doubt, list it as out of scope. It's easier to add later than to remove.

5. **Future Considerations**: Don't delete good ideas that are out of scope - park them here for later.
